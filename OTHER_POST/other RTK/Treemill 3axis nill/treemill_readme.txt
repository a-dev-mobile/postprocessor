This post is built for a Tree Mill 3-Axis machining center with Dynapath Control.  

The Dynapath control had very limited memory (180 KB), so we built to post to break up any NC Program into 120KB chunks.

We also left out any commentary data to save space.

The machine did not have a tool changer, so tool change information may be incorrect for your machine.

This post was tested at the machine in graphics mode only.  Test it yourself before using!
